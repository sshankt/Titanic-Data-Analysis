# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the famous **Titanic dataset** using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  
The main objective was to visualize the data and extract meaningful insights about the survival of passengers.

## 📌 Dataset Introduction
The dataset contains details of passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.  

### Key Columns:
- **Survived** → 0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived  
- **Pclass** → Passenger Class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)  
- **Name** → Passenger’s name  
- **Sex** → Gender of passenger  
- **Age** → Age in years  
- **SibSp** → Number of siblings/spouses aboard  
- **Parch** → Number of parents/children aboard  
- **Ticket** → Ticket number  
- **Fare** → Ticket fare  
- **Cabin** → Cabin number (many missing values)  
- **Embarked** → Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## ❓ Questions Explored
1. What is the **overall survival distribution**?  
2. How does **passenger class (Pclass)** affect survival?  
3. What is the **gender distribution** of passengers?  
4. How does **gender affect survival**?  
5. What is the **age distribution** of passengers?  
6. How does **age relate to survival**?  
7. What is the **fare distribution**? Are there any outliers?  
8. How does **embarkation port (C, Q, S)** affect survival?  
9. How does **family size (SibSp + Parch)** influence passenger distribution?

## 📊 Insights from Analysis
- ✅ More **women survived** compared to men.  
- ✅ **1st class passengers** had a much higher survival rate than 3rd class.  
- ✅ **Children** had better chances of survival compared to adults.  
- ✅ Passengers from **Cherbourg (C)** had a higher survival percentage.  
- ✅ Many passengers were traveling **alone**, with small family sizes.  
- ✅ The **fare distribution** was skewed with several high outliers.

## 📈 Visualizations
The following visualizations were created:
- Histogram → Age, Fare  
- Countplot → Survival, Pclass, Sex, Embarked  
- Barplot → Class vs Survival, Gender vs Survival, Embarked vs Survival  
- Boxplot → Age vs Survival  
- Scatterplot → Age vs Fare (colored by Gender)
